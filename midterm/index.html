        <p>A look at Outkast's history through the lens of data</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h3>The birth of southern slang</h3>
            <p>As a fan of hip hop etymology, I looked for Outkast's role as potential inventors of slang. Turns out
                that there’s definitely a case for Outkast first-use of "crunk" and "skeet".</p>
            <p>What I never realized is that this is consistent with Outkast’s position as the face of southern hip hop
                – "crunk" and "skeet" both originated from the south. Southern themes in hip hop are intimately
                connected to Outkast's legacy.</p>
            <p>Here's why: before Outkast, southern hip hop was jokingly called “country s---” by east/west-coast
                constituencies. People began to take the South more seriously when Outkast won the ’95 Source award for
                best new group. During the acceptance speech, the east/west-coast’s lack of respect for the south
                revealed itself in the form of boos from the audience.</p>
            <p>Big Boi paid tribute to New York and “all the original MCs,” but Andre decided to rant, "I’m tired of the
                close-minded folks. We got a demo tape and no one wants to hear it. But the south got something to
                say—that’s all I got to say."</p>
            <h3>Outkast's southern sound: ATL strip clubs, guitar riffs, and aliens</h3>
            <p>Beyond ATL slang, Outkast’s first four albums contain copious drawl and references to Atlanta (strip
                clubs, projects, neighborhoods, intersections, Cadillacs), creating a sound that was distinctly
                southern. </p>
            <p>There are countless anecdotes that Atlanta was absolutely captivated by Outkast's early music. Their
                music was heard on every street-corner and from cars driving by. Intersections and businesses referenced
                in the songs gained popularity. There’s even evidence of Puff Daddy directing Playa’s Ball (Outkast’s
                first single in ’94) and bringing Kangol hats back to NYC.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Outkast's sound became even more distinct when they began producing their own music on ATLiens (their
                second album). These self-produced songs are about aliens, stars, and Nuwabian Nation—just about as far
                as you can get from the glorification of pimps, guns, and drugs (east/west-coast themes).</p>
            <p>Rather than emulate the east/west-coast sound and image, Outkast brought a totally new approach to hip
                hop. From the beginning, Big Boi and Andre prided themselves on originality (hence the name, Outkast –
                to be different from the rest of the hip hop scene). “Skeet" and “crunk” were just part of what
                Outkast’s southern roots brought to hip hop.</p>

                        <p>Outkast are from East Point and went to Tri-Cities HS. Outkast became a staple for the south
                            since their music frequently references neighboring communities, such as College Park and
                            Decatur, or businesses, such as strip club Magic City.</p>

            <h3>The evolution of outkast's lyrical themes</h3>
            <p>With Outkast’s second album, their lyrics shifted to a completely new style, filled with positivity,
                non-violence, southern-life hardship, and guitar riffs. The next album (Aquemini) would take that even
                further, focusing on drug addiction, poverty, and morality.</p>
            <p>While this helped Outkast create a distinctive sound, it also reflected the events in their lives. What
                makes
                Outkast unique isn’t just their role in Southern hip hop, but unparalleled longevity – 6 outstanding
                albums
                across 12 years – chronicling their evolution from kids to adults, players to fathers, and relationships
                to
                break ups.</p>

            <h3>Life events to listen for on Outkast's discography</h3>
            <p>Each album is filled with cues for what Andre and Big Boi were experiencing at the time of its
                production.</p>
            <p>These events help explain the positive themes that begin on Outkast’s second album: Andre makes big
                personal
                changes, adopting veganism and leaving the drinking/drugs lifestyle. By Aquemini, he’s experimenting
                with
                new musical styles and growing tired of rapping.</p>

            <h3>Andre and Big Boi's creative approach</h3>
            <img src="img/approach.png" alt="Approach">
            <p>This is an obvious over-simplification and should convey Andre's movement away from hip hop – not Boi Boi
                lack of experimentation. In fact, Big Boi's recent solo work has taken several experimental directions,
                helping fans clearly identify his role on early Outkast tracks.</p>
            <p>What’s seemingly overlooked is Andre and Big Boi’s creative genius despite an increasingly divergent
                approach
                to music. Or as Big Boi puts it, "two unique, individual styles meshed together to make one monster
                mayhem
                musical mashup.”</p>
            <p>Andre is experimenting and growing beyond hip hop, yet Big Boi is perfectly content with maintaining the
                gangsta persona. Naturally, this creative tension leads to breakup rumors, a major theme represented on
                Aquemini. The two debate how long they can continue to make music together with such opposing styles,
                regardless of how ground-breaking the "musical mashup" is for hip hop.</p>
            <p>The first time Andre started to croon and modulate his voice, there’s this anecdote from an interview:
            </p>
            <p>The first time I did it, [Big] kinda pulled me to the side and said, ‘I just wanna let you know niggas in
                the
                street, they don’t be liking when you do your voice like that.’ But to me, in my head, I was like it
                sounds
                cool. Maybe I’m not transmitting it right but this is cool. So that really kinda gave me a push and I
                think
                my songwriting abilities were pushed in that way.</p>
            <div class="iframe-container">
                <iframe style="border-radius:12px"
                    src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3sQDstyMhCcDJ3mY6onZez?utm_source=generator" width="300%"

                </iframe>
            </div>
            <p>You hear this creative tension throughout Aquemini and Stankonia. When Outkast produced B.O.B., Big Boi
                worried that their base, hardcore hip hop fans in ATL’s hardest neighborhoods, would reject the heavy
                rock
                guitar riffs. Fortunately, the result was a net gain in fans who were traditionally non-hip-hop.</p>
            <p>Andre and Big Boi’s creative differences tragically climax on Speakerboxxx, with Andre and Big Boi at
                their
                most distant (and coincidentally, height of popularity). If you’re an Outkast fan from the beginning,
                you
                see stylistic differences continue to compound. As early as Aquemini (‘98), they admitted that they
                would
                pursue solo works after their next album. After Idlewild's completion in ‘06, a hiatus is almost
                inevitable.
                When Andre says he’s tired of hip hop and rapping, the experiment ran its course.</p>
            <p>This sheds light on the motivations for an Outkast reunion in 2014. It wasn't the reunion of two
                out-of-the-spotlight rappers. It’s wasn't an Outkast needs to get paid tour. It wasn't Andre and Big Boi
                failed at solo either. Andre and Big are interconnected souls, whose lives are documented across six
                albums.
                History suggests that the "reunion" was part of their plan, and it shouldn't be viewed as the
                reconciliation
                of a shocking break-up.</p>
            <h3>Effect on the trajectory of hip hop, pop music</h3>
            <p>When Outkast won a Grammy in ‘04 for Speakerboxxx, Andre lamented in the acceptance speech, "People
                thought
                our first album was Stankonia. It’s Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik." While Outkast was at their peak of
                popularity in '04, few people appreciated (or even knew of) their first three albums (that’s 10 years of
                Outkast music history).</p>
            <img src="img/trajectory.png" alt="Trajectory">
            <p>In particular, Aquemini ('98) scored a perfect rating from the Source. At this point, Outkast's attempts
                to
                be unique achieved impressive results: a new sub-genre/sound (the dirty south) and ascendancy in hip
                hop.
            </p>
            <p>While Andre may have felt that Outkast's previous work didn't get enough respect, Stankonia was a
                breakthrough moment for hip hop – full acceptance of the genre by the music establishment. It was a huge
                step away from traditional hip hop, borrowing heavily from George Clinton-Funk, jazz, blues, and rock.
                As
                Andre experimented with rock and Big Boi held onto his hardcore hip hop style, they had the ingredients
                to
                make their version of hip hop palatable to a mainstream audience and attract new fans to the genre.</p>
