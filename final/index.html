            <h1>Lyrics to Life: Unpacking Mac Miller's Struggles with Substance Abuse Through His Music</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <p>Before his foreseeably tragic death from a drug overdose at age 26, Malcolm McCormick (better known as
                Mac Miller) had an incredible trajectory in his music– one that blatantly reflected his fluctuating
                mental state while making his six studio albums and 13 mixtapes. As his struggle with drug abuse and
                relationship problems evolved, so too did the intensity and themes of his work.</p>
            <h2>Miller's albums and mixtapes by release date</h2>
            <img src="img/music_timeline.png" alt="timeline">
            <h2>Kickin' Incredibly Dope Shit (mixtape) - 2010</h2>
            <p>Miller had listeners wanting to jump for joy in “Kickin’ Incredibly Dope Shit.” He sang about smoking
                weed in the shining sun, skipping class in high school and riding around town with the windows down.
                Though Miller had clearly begun his experimentation with drugs, singing fondly about getting high, his
                positive outlook on life in “Knock Knock” and “The Spins” showed he was just getting started in his
                career.</p>
            <h2>I Love Life, Thank You (mixtape) - 2011</h2>
            <p>Based on the album’s name, it’s clear that Miller still felt like a kid. “Chicken wings and fries, I’m in
                love with all the simple things,” he said in his titular song. With optimism and joy radiating from his
                music, Miller’s delve into drugs was masked by the jubilance of “Love Lost”.</p>
            <h2>Blue Slide Park (debut studio album) - 2011</h2>
            <p>While surviving off the motivation of his youth, Miller dipped into relationship problems and gained
                insight into the realities of stardom. “Missed Calls” not only demonstrated some of his best work, but
                also shed light onto the real problems that came with maturing, making money and using drugs.</p>

            <h2>Macadelic (mixtape) - 2012</h2>
            <p>Miller’s clear continued use of drugs manifested itself into addictive, psychedelic sounds. Featuring
                bigger artists like Kendrick Lamar, Lil Wayne and Juicy J, Miller explored the various experiences with
                love and drugs he had thus far. “Can’t Fight the Feeling,” “Aliens Fighting Robots” and “The Question”
                highlight the best of Miller’s psychedelic sounds. Sad-toned and desperate, “The Mourning After”
                directly followed the high energy of “Lucky Ass Bitch,” demonstrating Miller’s conflicting personas.</p>
            <h2>Watching Movies with the Sound Off (album) - 2013</h2>
            <p>Genius called this album Miller’s transition from “frat rap,” entering self-reflective lyricism. Miller
                began exploring themes of death and mortality in "S.D.S.," and in “Red Dot Music,” he sang about using
                drugs until death. The dark ambiance of the album reflected both his maturity and downward spiral as his
                drug addiction took over.</p>

            <h2>Faces (mixtape) - 2014</h2>
            <p>In 2017, Miller tweeted “I was not on planet earth when I made Faces. Nowhere close.” Facing the
                realities of stardom, Miller fell deeper into drug abuse. This album highlighted his introspective
                persona, now
                completely abandoning his “frat rap” days. In “Wedding,” Miller sang about failing relationships, while
                in “Funeral,” Miller once again offered unintentional foreshadowing, rapping about living life as if
                it’s your last day.</p>

            <h2>GO:OD AM (album) - 2015</h2>
            <p>More energetic than ever, GO:OD AM was Miller’s attempt to pull himself out of the drug-induced
                introspective loop he was trapped in. “Weekend” became a classic party song, and “ROS” was a heartfelt
                ode to a past lover. Miller didn’t mask his ongoing struggles with drug abuse, as heard in “Perfect
                Circle/God Speed,” but his transformed, upbeat persona diluted the dark themes of the song.</p>
            <h2>The Divine Feminine (album) - 2016</h2>
            <p>Here, we heard an entirely new Miller. Largely attributed to his public relationship with singer Ariana
                Grande, Miller sang of falling in love with a person and being saved by it. “God is Fair, Sexy Nasty”
                blends Miller’s new religious perspectives with his everlasting love for one thing: women. As he sang of
                divinity and drugs, Miller seemed to gain a newfound appreciation for the femininity of the world.</p>
            <h2>Swimming (album) - 2018</h2>
            <p>“Swimming” was the last album released while Miller was alive. Post-breakup with Grande and a DUI arrest,
                this album was Miller trying to swim out of his troubles rather than drown in them. Miller’s attempt to
                better himself was tragically evident, with “Wings” being about his optimism for the future. Though
                “Swimming” was released just a month before Miller’s sudden death, his unwavering hope was a beautiful
                beacon from the album’s delve into depression.</p>

            <h2>Mention of drugs (marijuana, cocaine, opiates) by album/mixtape</h2>
            <img src="img/drug_mention_data.png" alt="Drug data">
            <h2>Circles (album) - 2020</h2>
            <p>Released posthumously, Miller’s “Circles” was meant to be a follow-up to “Swimming,” insinuating that
                Miller is “Swimming in Circles.” He felt as though he couldn’t escape his inevitable cycles that trapped
                him in his bad habits, and were the cause of his demise. The gentle, optimistic tone of “Good News”
                became tragically ironic as it was released following Miller’s overdose.</p>
