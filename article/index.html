            <p><i><b>The Persistence of Memory</b></i> (Spanish: <i>La persistencia de la memoria</i>) is a 1931
                painting by artist Salvador Dalí and one of the most recognizable works of Surrealism. First shown at
                the Julien Levy Gallery in 1932, since 1934 the painting has been in the collection of the Museum of
                Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, which received it from an anonymous donor. It is widely recognized
                and frequently referred to in popular culture, and sometimes referred to by more descriptive titles,
                such as "The Melting Clocks", "The Soft Watches" or "The Melting Watches".</p>

            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>The well-known surrealist piece introduced the image of the soft melting pocket watch. It epitomizes
                Dalí's theory of "softness" and "hardness", which was central to his thinking at the time. As Dawn Adès
                wrote, "The soft watches are an unconscious symbol of the relativity of space and time, a Surrealist
                meditation on the collapse of our notions of a fixed cosmic order". This interpretation suggests that
                Dalí was incorporating an understanding of the world introduced by Albert Einstein's theory of special
                relativity. Asked by Ilya Prigogine whether this was the case, Dalí replied that the soft watches were
                not inspired by the theory of relativity, but by the surrealist perception of a Camembert melting in the
                sun.

                The year prior to painting the <i> Persistence of Memory, </i> Dali developed his "paranoiac-critical
                method," deliberately inducing psychotic hallucinations to inspire his art. He remarked, "The difference
                between a madman and me is that I am not mad." This quote highlights Dali's awareness of his mental
                state. Despite his engagement in activities that could be seen as insane, Dali maintained that he was
                not actually mad.

            <h2>Versions</h2>
            <img src="img/disintegration_of_persistence_of_memory.jpg"
                alt="The Disintegration of Persistence of Memory">
            <p>Dalí returned to the theme of this painting with the variation <i>The Disintegration of the Persistence
                    of Memory </i>(1954), showing his earlier famous work systematically fragmenting into smaller
                component elements, and a series of rectangular blocks which reveal further imagery through the gaps
                between them, implying something beneath the surface of the original work; this work is now in the
                Salvador Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, while the original Persistence of Memory remains at the
                Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Dalí also produced various lithographs and sculptures on the
                theme of soft watches late in his career. Some of these sculptures are <i>Persistence of Memory,
                    Nobility of Time, Profile of Time, and Three Dancing Watches.</i></p>

            <h2>Aftermath</h2>
            <p>Between 1952 and 1954, Dalí reinterprets his classic painted twenty years earlier. <i>The Disintegration
                    of the Persistence of Memory </i>is just as intriguing! Everything has changed since the 1930s and
                the artist knows it too well. In this piece, he explores the subject of technological progress.
                Portlligat is now flooded: “everything is suspended in space without anything touching anything”. The
                pocket watches break down into molecules… Dalí let go of his obsession for psychoanalysis and starts
                exploring nuclear physics and religion. Heisenberg, the said “new father” of the artist, inspires him
                partly the work. The tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki also play a role in the creation of this
                version of the painting. </p>
